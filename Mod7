It seems like a major problem with using big data in any kind of capacity--academic or otherwise--is the “unwitting participants” that are used in such research. For example, Facebook’s use of unregulated research on data from its users (Fiske, S., & Hauser, R., 2014).
“To protect human subjects more effectively, according to the no-greater-then-minimal-risk standard, the panel recommends first understanding the risks in daily life of the general population.” (Fiske, S., & Hauser, R., 2014). The goal would be that unwitting participants would be put in no more risk than what they would incur in normal, everyday life.
The problem is that people are complex. So what might be not much of a risk--like Facebook sharing that you joined a certain group--for some people, is a huge problem for others. There was a story a while back where a college student was effectively cutoff from their family after their parents had learned that they had joined a certain group on Facebook.
I imagine things would have to get really bad before everyone abandons Facebook, but it is an option that voluntary participants (like Facebook users) have.
