Level 2 Header
Whenever you use a source, it must be cited both in text and in the references. However, there are two types of sources that should only be cited in text and do not need to be included on the References page: (a) Sources that do not produce recoverable data and cannot be located by the reader, such as personal communications, and (b) Religious texts and classical works, such as the Bible, the Qur’an, and Greek or Roman works. Both your in-text citations and references should follow APA style. In academic writing that follows APA style, it is important to paraphrase source material whenever possible, as opposed to quoting the source directly. When paraphrasing source material, you can use page numbers to point the reader to a specific portion of the source, but this is optional. When paraphrasing, you should follow the paraphrased material with an in-text citation that contains the author’s last name and the source’s year of publication (Author, Year) or use a signal phrase to introduce the paraphrased material with the author and year (ex: “According to Eriksson (2015)...”). When quoting source material directly, a page number (p. ) or page range (pp. ) is always required. If the source does not include page numbers, use a paragraph number (para. ) instead. When citing in text, parenthetical citations should appear as close to the source material as possible. The author’s name should never be separate from the year of publication.
In-text citations point readers to the References page, which is a list of all the sources used in your assignment. When formatting the References page, start a new page. Then, type and center the word References at the top, but do not use any additional formatting (e.g., bold, underline, italics, quotation marks, etc.). Alphabetize the references according to the first author’s last name or by the name of the organization if there is no individual author for a text. All references should have a hanging indent: The first line of each reference should be flush with the left margin, and subsequent lines should be indented. Finally, each reference should follow APA style, and the proper formatting will change depending on the type of source.
Conclusion
The last section or paragraph of your paper should be the conclusion. A conclusion should reiterate the major points of your argument. To do this, think about developing your thesis by adding more detail or by retracing the steps of your argument. You can recap major sections for the reader. You can also summarize the primary supporting points or evidence you discussed in the paper. The conclusion should not introduce any new information in order to avoid confusing the reader. To end the paper, think about what you want your reader to do with all the information you just presented. Explain what logical next steps might be taken in order to learn more about this topic. Use the conclusion to establish the significance and importance of your work, motivate others to build on what you’ve done in this paper, and encourage the reader to explore new ideas or reach other conclusions.
